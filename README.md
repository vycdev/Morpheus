Morpheus is a feature-rich Discord bot written in C# using Discord.NET and Entity Framework Core. It provides moderation helpers, a quotes subsystem with approval workflows, activity tracking, interactions (buttons/menus), and utility commands — all driven by a PostgreSQL database.

Key features include: quote submission & approval, per-quote voting/rating, guild-configurable approval channels, user activity jobs, and extensible command modules.
